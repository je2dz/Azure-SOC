# Creating a SOC with Honeynet within Microsoft Azure

## Introduction

For this project I utilized Microsoft Azure to create a honeynet and ingest logs from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace. From there, I used Microsoft Sentinel to create attack maps, trigger alerts, and incidents.  I then gathered metrics over a 24-hour period in the insecure environment. From there I applied security controls to harden the environment and repeated the 24-hour period to gather more metrics in the secured environment. I then used the metrics to geographically map the attackerâ€™s locations and summarize the overall improvement after applying security controls. 

<br />

## Metrics Gathered

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents Created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

### Azure Components & Technologies Utilized:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 Windows, 1 Linux) 
- Log Analytics Workspace with KQL Queries
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Defender for the Cloud
- Windows Remote Desktop
- Command Line Interface
- PowerShell

## Architecture Before Hardening / Security Controls

Initially, all resources were deployed with exposure for the "BEFORE" metrics. The VMs were configured with their NSGs and built-in firewalls set to allow all traffic, and all other resources were also deployed with public endpoints that were visible to the internet. Consequently, Private Endpoints were not utilized.

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

To improve the "AFTER" metrics, NSGs were made more secure by prohibiting ALL traffic except for my admin workstation, while all other resources were safegaurded by their own built-in firewalls in addition to Private Endpoints.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

Measured metrics in the insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-04-09 11:30 AM EST
Stop Time 2023-04-10 11:30 AM EST

| Metric                                          | Count
| ----------------------------------------------- | -----
| SecurityEvents (Windows VMs)                    | 34,063
| Syslog (Linux VM)                               | 7783
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud)    | 12
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)           | 295
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed             | 624

<br />

## Attack Maps AFTER Hardening / Security Controls

```There were no results to display for the 24 hour repeat map queries following the hardening of the assets. ```

<br />

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

Measured metrics in the secure environment for another 24 hours after applying security controls:
Start Time 2023-04-10 11:30 AM EST
Stop Time	2023-04-11 11:30 AM EST

| Metric                                          | Count
| ----------------------------------------------- | -----
| SecurityEvents (Windows VMs)                    | 11,679
| Syslog (Linux VM)                               | 33
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud)    | 0
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)           | 10
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed             | 30

<br />

## Overall Improvement

| Metric                                          | Count
| ----------------------------------------------- | -----
| SecurityEvents (Windows VMs)                    | -65.71%
| Syslog (Linux VM)                               | -99.58%
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud)    | -100%
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)           | -96.61%
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed             | -95.19%

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was constructed in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was employed to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Additionally, metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied, and then again after implementing security measures. It is noteworthy that the number of security events and incidents were drastially reduced after the security controls were applied, demonstrating their effectiveness.

It is worth noting that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, it is likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.

## Simulated Attacks

While the environment was configured for vulnerabilities, I took the opportunity simulate specific attacks via PowerShell scripts. The results were observed in Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel Incident Creation.  

- Linux Brute Force Attempt 
- AAD Brute Force Success 
- Windows Brute Force Success
- Malware Detection (EICAR Test File) 
- Privilege Escalation
