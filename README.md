# Creating a SOC & Honeynet within Microsoft Azure

## Introduction

For this project I utilized Microsoft Azure to create a honeynet and ingest logs from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace. From there, I used Microsoft Sentinel to create attack maps, trigger alerts, and incidents.  I then gathered metrics over a 24-hour period in the insecure environment. From there I applied security controls to harden the environment and repeated the 24-hour period to gather more metrics in the secured environment. I then used the metrics to geographically map the attackerâ€™s locations and summarize the overall improvement after applying security controls. 

<br />

## Metrics Gathered

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents Created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)

## Architecture of the Lab

### Azure Components & Technologies Utilized:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 Windows, 1 Linux) 
- Log Analytics Workspace with KQL Queries
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Microsoft Defender for the Cloud
- Windows Remote Desktop
- Windows Command Line Interface
-

## Architecture Before Hardening / Security Controls

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were originally deployed, exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls wide open, and all other resources are deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet; aka, no use for Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic with the exception of my admin workstation, and all other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as Private Endpoint

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-04-09 09:45 AM EST
Stop Time 2023-04-10 09:45 AM EST

| Metric                                          | Count
| ----------------------------------------------- | -----
| SecurityEvents (Windows VMs)                    | 33,456
| Syslog (Linux VM)                               | 7789
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud)    | 14
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)           | 295
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed             | 619

```The remaining map queries returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-04-10 09:45 AM EST
Stop Time	2023-04-11 09:45 AM EST

| Metric                                          | Count
| ----------------------------------------------- | -----
| SecurityEvents (Windows VMs)                    | 10,519
| Syslog (Linux VM)                               | 34
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud)    | 0
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)           | 14
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed             | 44

<br />

## Overall Improvement

| Metric                                          | Count
| ----------------------------------------------- | -----
| SecurityEvents (Windows VMs)                    | -68.56%
| Syslog (Linux VM)                               | -99.56%
| SecurityAlert (Microsoft Defender for Cloud)    | -100%
| SecurityIncident (Sentinel Incidents)           | -95.25%
| NSG Inbound Malicious Flows Allowed             | -92.89%

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was constructed in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was employed to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Additionally, metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied, and then again after implementing security measures. It is noteworthy that the number of security events and incidents were drastially reduced after the security controls were applied, demonstrating their effectiveness.

It is worth noting that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, it is likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
